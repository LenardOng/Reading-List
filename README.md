# An ongoing list of books read and short reviews

## This is mainly a personal list to keep track of readings

### There is currently only one file, [Books.md](Books.md), that contains mini-reviews of books. There is a plan to extend this to a full chapter by chapter review of books in the future

### Prior knowledge that the views expressed here are from
