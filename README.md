# An ongoing list of knowledge sourced from books / online courses

## This is mainly a personal list to keep track of readings and things I've learned from the books that I've read. 
The list is located at [Books.md](Books.md).

## There is now a new list to cover Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) that I've been going through. 
The list is located at [MOOC.md](MOOC.md).

The focus will be on MOOCs.
