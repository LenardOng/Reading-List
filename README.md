# An ongoing list of knowledge sourced from books / online courses

## This is mainly a personal list to keep track of readings and things I've learned or completed.
 
## There is now a new list to cover Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) that I've been going through. 
The list is located at [MOOC.md](MOOC.md).

The focus will be on MOOCs. MOOCs offer a good balance of learning, extra reading and practical assessments.

The old book list is located at [Books.md](Books.md). However, without proper coding exercises it is difficult to recall readings. Hence it is recommended to translate knowledge to application relatively quickly for content clarification.
