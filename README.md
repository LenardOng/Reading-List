# An ongoing list of books read and short reviews

## This is mainly a personal list to keep track of readings and things I've learned from the books that I've read. 
The list is located at [Books.md](Books.md).

The focus while reading through these books is not a thorough understanding, but rather as a brief read through, with the hopes that multiple exposure of the same topic from different angles will help overall understanding more than remaining stuck on a topic for a longer period of time. Revisiting difficult books later down the line after reading 'simpler' books definitely helped me understand and grasp difficult topics that are otherwise very difficult to self-learn.

Reading multiple books increase the number of impressions that each idea makes, which helps the human memory recall common ideas.
