# An ongoing list of books read and short reviews

## This is mainly a personal list to keep track of readings and things I've learned from the books that I've read. 
The list is located at [Books.md](Books.md).

## There is now a new list to cover Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) that I've completed. The list is located at [MOOC.md](MOOC.md).

The focus while reading through these books was not a thorough understanding, but rather a brief read through, with the motivation that multiple exposures of the same topic from different angles will help overall understanding more than remaining stuck on a topic for a longer period of time. Revisiting difficult books later down the line after reading 'simpler' books definitely helped me understand and grasp difficult topics that are otherwise very difficult to self-learn.

Reading multiple books increase the number of impressions that each idea makes, which helps the human memory recall common ideas.

Mixing in MOOCs for practical learning to go from theory in books to practice in code.
