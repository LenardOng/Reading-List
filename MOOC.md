# List of MOOCs
These MOOCs span multiple weeks and hence will be updated much slower (based on my personal capacity!)

# On-going
+ Machine Learning on Coursera by Andrew Ng (Stanford University)

Total of 11 weeks
Finished second week exercise on Linear Regression
Finished third week exercise on Logistic Regression
Finished fourth week exercise on Multi-class classification and a 1 hidden layer Neural Network
Working on the fifth week now (3 weeks ahead)

Introduction to powerful methods that are not just Neural Networks
Helped explain concepts from on-going machine learning course in university and to try things out in code
Really appreciate the exercises in understanding and implementation

Week 1 - Introduction, 1 variable Linear Regression and Linear Algebra
Week 2 - Multivariate Linear Regression
Week 3 - Logistic Regression and Regularisation
    Gradient of the logistic cost function having the same structure as the gradient for linear regression
Week 4 - Neural Network: Representation and Multi-class Classification
    Implementation of a simple 1 layer Neural Network
Week 5 - Neural Network: Learning



Use of Octave (Not as popular recently... but works anyway!)

On week 5 now
