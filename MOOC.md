# List of MOOCs
These MOOCs span multiple weeks and hence will be updated much slower (based on my personal capacity!)

# On-going
+ Machine Learning on Coursera by Andrew Ng (Stanford University)

Total of 11 weeks
+ Finished second week exercise on Linear Regression
+ Finished third week exercise on Logistic Regression
+ Finished fourth week exercise on Multi-class classification and a 1 hidden layer Neural Network
+ Finished fifth week exercise on coding the back-propagation for weight updating including skipping bias terms in the back-propagation
+ Finished sixth week exercise on regularised linear regression using cross-validation for selecting model parameters and checking the bias-variance problem
+ Finished seventh week exercise on the implementing data-preprocessing for email SVM classification using cross-validation for SVM parameters

Working on the eighth week now (5 weeks ahead)

Introduction to powerful methods that are not just Neural Networks
Helped explain concepts from on-going machine learning course in university and to try things out in code
Really appreciate the exercises in understanding and implementation

Week 1 - Introduction, 1 variable Linear Regression and Linear Algebra
Week 2 - Multivariate Linear Regression
Week 3 - Logistic Regression and Regularisation
    Gradient of the logistic cost function having the same structure as the gradient for linear regression
Week 4 - Neural Network: Representation and Multi-class Classification
    Implementation of a simple 1 layer Neural Network - Forward pass
Week 5 - Neural Network: Learning
    Coding back-propagation for a multi-class 1 hidden layer classifier
Week 6 - Advice for applying machine learning
    Cross validation as a diagnostic tool for learning algorithms
Week 7 - SVM
    Cross validation for the SVM task
Week 8 - 



Use of Octave (Not as popular recently... but works anyway!)
