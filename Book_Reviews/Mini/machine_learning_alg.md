# Machine Learning: An Algorithmic Perspective

### What's different
* Useful in giving code that works. Much of machine learning involves writing code to process large amounts of data. Focus on Big-O complexity and providing easy to understand code is very beneficial to the aspiring machine learning enthusiast. 
* The Kalman filter makes a strange appearance alongside expectation maximisation algorithms

### What else is good
* Practical introduction for those wanting to understand the intuition between popular tools such SciKit or Numpy as well as deep learning frameworks like Keras, Tensorflow and Caffe. 
* Inclusion of many different types of dimensionality reduction whilst the most commonly heard ones are just PCA and ICA.
* Exploration vs Exploitation - Basic definitions and a few algorithms. Good introduction to reinforcement learning
* Explanation of various optimization techniques

### What can be improved
*	Maybe more explanation in applications, emphasising the distinction and uses between the four major machine learning problems, dimensionality reduction, regression, classification and clustering.

### Things I need to revisit
* Viterbi
* Particle Filter
* Hopsfield
* Boltzmann machine
* Contrastive Divergence Learning
