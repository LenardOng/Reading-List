## Bayesian Artificial Intelligence

### What's different
* Very historical look into the different probability theories
* Very in depth for anyone new to Bayesian idealogy
* Primary focus on Bayesian Networks with many medical examples

### What else is good
* Serves as a decent guide with common mistakes to avoid 
* In depth practical description on the construction of Bayesian Neural Networks
* One of the better explanations on the bias variance trade-off I've read

### What can be improved
* A lot of fluff about the history and evolution of the ideas, not necessarily a bad thing but there could be a larger focus on state-of-the-art algorithms and comparison results to other machine learning techniques
* Information theory is introduced very late in the book, whereas it is an important idea that should be introduced much earlier
