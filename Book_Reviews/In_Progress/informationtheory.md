## Information Theory, Inference and Algorithms
### What's different
+ Large focus on Shannon Information Theory
+ Theory of compression with an emphasis on information theory
### What else is good
+ Very practical with many examples with accompanying solutions to assist learning
+ Clearest definition of probability I've read
### What can be improved
+ Easy to get lost in the maths unless working through exercises
