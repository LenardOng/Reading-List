## Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning
### Introduction to my experience with this book
This is a very highly recommended book that I initially had many problems understanding reading during my third year of Engineering Science. Since then, I've been through information engineering courses and have read other books to catch up with the required knowledge to understand this book. 

This is probably not the best introductory book, but is self contained and gradually introduces many difficult concepts and theories that the machine learning engineer should know.

### What's different
+ Probably the best book out there by the amount of material is being covered
+ There's a whole lot of difficult concepts introduced gradually in an understandable way
+ Historical introduction of the different mathematicians

### What else is good
+ Clearer in explanation on the Information Theory front than McKay
+ Soft introduction to Gaussian Processes

### What can be improved


## Brief personal summary of the book and things that I've learned from the book
### Chapter 1 - Introduction
+ Quick introduction to problems such as overfitting and regularisation in the least squares problem
+ Moves quickly into probability theory and Bayesian probabilities (Very key to understand for practical machine learning)
+ A clear explanation of the curse of dimensionality and its problems in practical machine learning
+ Brief decision theory and its role in loss function based inference
+ Good introduction to information theory and its influence in machine learning that does not overstay its welcome

### Chapter 2 - Probability Distributions
+ Introduction to different distributions including important distributions for multinomial classification
+ Beginner's introduction to Gaussian processes and conjugate priors for Bayesian Machine Learning
+ The normal distribution can be derived from an optimisation problem with moment optimisation with a probability summation constraint
+ Periodicity trick using von Mises distribution for continuous and period Gaussian distributions


### Things I need to revisit
+ Non-parametric methods
