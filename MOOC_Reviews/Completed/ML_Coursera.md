Machine Learning by Stanford University on Coursera

+ Introduction to powerful methods that are not just Neural Networks
+ Helped explain concepts from on-going machine learning course in university and to try things out in code
+ Really appreciate the exercises in understanding and implementation
+ Quiz focus on practical details rather than specific science or maths behind it. Enough to give an intuition

### Total of 11 weeks
Week 1 - Introduction, 1 variable Linear Regression and Linear Algebra
Week 2 - Multivariate Linear Regression
Week 3 - Logistic Regression and Regularisation
+ Gradient of the logistic cost function having the same structure as the gradient for linear regression
Week 4 - Neural Network: Representation and Multi-class Classification
+ Implementation of a simple 1 layer Neural Network - Forward pass
Week 5 - Neural Network: Learning
+Coding back-propagation for a multi-class 1 hidden layer classifier
Week 6 - Advice for applying machine learning
+ Cross validation as a diagnostic tool for learning algorithms
Week 7 - SVM
+ Cross validation for the SVM task 
Week 8 - Unsupervised learning: Clustering and Dimensionality reduction
+ Focus on clustering
Week 9 - Anomaly detection and recommendation susterms
+ Anomaly detection as a form of statistical density fitting
+ Light on the statistics behind the process
+ Collaborative filtering - Notation for the gradient function was difficult
Week 10 - Large Scale Machine Learning
+ Map reduce & Online learning
Week 11 - Application Example: Photo OCR
+ Ceiling Analysis
+ Cheap to annotate a large dataset

Use of Octave (Not as popular... but works anyway!)
