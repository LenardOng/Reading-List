## Business Intelligence with Excel 2013 on Udemy - 4 hours 

### Summary
+ 4 hours of video
+ The motivation for this course was to find an alternative to Tableau that can load the data required from multiple sources
+ Covers Excel PowerPivot, PowerView, PowerQuery (Now just "Get Data") 

### Opinion
+ "Get Data" provides a comprehensive ETL service, that can take information directly from SQL, noSQL, Excel, CSV, OData, SAP, Azure. It is pretty amazing in the functionality provided, along with data refreshing capabilities that still apply the designed filters. This allows the user to implement once, and retain the functionality as the database becomes more updated. 
+ PowerPivot provides a connection directly to the ETL data and can quickly pivot the columns to allow more insights
+ PowerView provides a quick way to create interactive dashboards. Problem with silverlight that prevents certain features from working on a secure locked-down computer. Good quick alternative to other solutions such as Tableau and d3. 
+ It was surprising how such features exist in Excel but are hidden to the average user. 
+ It would be good if more awareness was brought to such features to improve efficiency in generating meaningful reports in admin processes.
