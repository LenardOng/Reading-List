## React Native and Solidity The Complete Developer's Guide on Udemy - 24 hours 

### Summary
+ 24 hours of video
+ Covers smart contracts (solidity), blockchain (ethereum) and web development (React and Next)
+ Simulation using Rinkeby test network
+ Large focus on the front end development using babel, webpack, next.js, node.js, react

### Opinion
+ Good introduction, first full, long Udemy course taken. 
+ Udemy Courses are faster, but don't have as much assessed practicals. 
+ Blockchain implementation using an ethereum-based network using solidity smart contracts is technically not too difficult.
+ This means that the quality of education may not be as good as an equivalent on Cousera.
+ Good that code used is provided, maybe a few more practical assessments would brush up the overall course quality
