## Exploring AWS IoT - 5.5 hours 

### Summary
+ 5.5 hours of video
+ Quick introduction to AWS Services that cover IoT, including the intial certifying security exchange, streaming analytics, passing information back and forth using MQTT protocol
+ Introduction to AWS IoT, FreeRTOS, AWS Glue, AWS Data Pipeline, Kinesis Firehose, AWS Lambda functions, AWS IoT Analytics
+ Quick course, probably need more examples or details

### Opinion
+ Good to have an ESP8266 or similar before starting to follow the videos
+ Probably a little too rushed, would have to go through the course again in the future
+ Presentation could be improved, as the topic and scope is quite ambitious to cover in 5.5 hours
+ AWS should have kept their implementation of FreeRTOS open-source
