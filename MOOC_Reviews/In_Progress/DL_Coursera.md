## Deep Learning Specialisation on Coursera

### Summary
+ Broken down into 5 sub-courses
    + Neural Networks and Deep Learning
    + Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularisation and Optimisation
    + Structuring Machine Learning Projects
    + Convolutional Neural Networks
    + Sequence Models
+ Total of 16 weeks
+ Coding is now in Python 3 rather than Octave/Matlab and happens in a Jupyter Notebook rather than a separate program. Evaluation happens by analysing the notebook.


## Neural Networks and Deep Learning

### Total of 4 weeks
+ Introduction to deep learning
    + Material very similar to Machine Learning Coursera MOOC
+ Neural Networks Basics
    + A little more basic than expected, assumes no knowledge of gradients or the chain rule
    + Coding felt a little too guided compared to ML Course
+ Shallow neural networks
    + Faster and clearer introduction to stacking layers in networks than ML Course
    + More time spent on vectorisation - How it works and its structure
    + Updated with newer and more trendy activation functions
+ Deep Neural Networks
    + More focus on matrix dimension consistency (Usually handled by the deep learning library, but good for understanding)
    +
