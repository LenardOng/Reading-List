## Bayesian Artificial Intelligence
### What's different
* Very historical look into the different probability theories
* Very in depth for anyone new to Bayesian idealogy
* Primary focus on Bayesian Networks with many medical examples

### What else is good
* Serves as a decent guide with common mistakes to avoid 
* In depth practical description on the construction of Bayesian Neural Networks
* One of the better explanations on the bias variance trade-off I've read

### What can be improved
* A lot of fluff about the history and evolution of the ideas, not necessarily a bad thing but there could be a larger focus on state-of-the-art algorithms and comparison results to other machine learning techniques
* Information theory is introduced very late in the book, whereas it is an important idea that should be introduced much earlier
    
# In progress

## Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning
### What's different
+ Probably the best book out there by the amount of material is being covered
### What else is good
+ Clearer in explanation on the Information Theory front than McKay
+ Soft introduction to Gaussian Processes
### What can be improved

## Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning
### What's different
### What else is good
+ Bayesian interpretation of common machine learning techniques
### What can be improved

## Convex Optimisation
### What's different
### What else is good
### What can be improved

## Information Theory, Inference and Algorithms
### What's different
+ Large focus on Shannon Information Theory
+ Theory of compression with an emphasis on information theory
### What else is good
+ Very practical with many examples with accompanying solutions to assist learning
+ Clearest definition of probability I've read
### What can be improved
+ Easy to get lost in the maths unless working through exercises
    
## The Elements of Statistical Learning
### What's different
+ This was recommended as a post-graduate level book
+ Very difficult to follow without a strong foundation in the underlying theory
### What else is good
+ Emphasis on the creation of a separating hyperplane
+ Covers regression very quickly and thoroughly with commonly used regularization techniques
### What can be improved
	
## Neural Networks and Learning Machines
### What's different
### What else is good
### What can be improved
+ Not very useful a book for learning as its easy to get lost in the unnecessary maths
